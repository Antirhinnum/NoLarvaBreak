# No Larva Break

![No Larva Break mod icon](icon.png)

**No Larva Break** is a tModLoader mod that does exactly what it says on the tin: Queen Bee larva can no longer be broken by stray projectiles or weapons. 

Players must actually hit the larva with a pickaxe (or break the blocks under it) to summon Queen Bee.
